                Joan Miró i Ferrà (20 April 1893 – 25 December 1983) was a Spanish
                painter, sculptor and ceramicist born in Barcelona. A museum dedicated
                to his work, the Fundació Joan Miró, was established in his native
                city of Barcelona in 1975, and another, the Fundació Pilar i Joan
                Miró, was established in his adoptive city of Palma de Mallorca in
                1981.

                Earning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as
                Surrealism but with a personal style, sometimes also veering into
                Fauvism and Expressionism. He was notable for his interest in the
                unconscious or the subconscious mind, reflected in his re-creation of
                the childlike. His difficult to classify works also had a
                manifestation of Catalan pride. In numerous interviews dating from the
                1930s onwards, Miró expressed contempt for conventional painting
                methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and declared an
                assassination of painting in favour of upsetting the visual elements
                of established painting.

                ..I've been touched, in the work of Miró and Pollock, by a Surrealist
                – by Surrealist I mean 'associative' – quality. It's what comes
                through in association after your eye has experienced the surface as a
                great picture; it is incidental but can be enriching.
