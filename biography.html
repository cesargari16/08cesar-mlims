            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Tyler, the Creator, whose real name is Tyler Gregory Okonma, is an American rapper, record producer, and
                music video director. He was born on March 6, 1991, in Ladera Heights, California. He is best known as
                the leader of the alternative hip hop collective Odd Future.

                Tyler began his music career in 2007, when he formed Odd Future and began releasing music under the name
                Tyler, the Creator. He released his debut solo album, "Goblin," in 2011, which received widespread
                critical acclaim. The album features dark and controversial lyrics, and cemented Tyler's reputation as a
                provocative and controversial figure in the music industry.

            <p>
                He then released "Wolf" in 2013 and "Cherry Bomb" in 2015, both of which received positive reviews from
                critics and fans alike. In 2017, he released "Flower Boy" which was considered a departure from his
                previous style and was critically acclaimed for its more introspective and personal lyrics.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to his solo work, Tyler has also collaborated with a number of other artists, including
                Frank Ocean, A$AP Rocky, and Kali Uchis. He is also known for his music videos, which often feature
                surreal and over-the-top imagery.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to his music career, Tyler is also involved in fashion, having released his own clothing
                line, Golf Wang, and has also designed clothing for other brands. He also has a television show on
                Viceland called Nuts + Bolts.

                Okonma's music has been variously considered alternative hip hop, bedroom pop, jazz rap, R&B, and neo
                soul, while his earlier music was considered horrorcore. Over the years, his style of production has
                progressed from gritty and dark in early projects such as Goblin, but soon transitioned to a more
                jazz-based approach, with the album Cherry Bomb, which Okonma described in 2018 as his favorite album.
                During his acceptance of the Cultural Influence Award at the BET Awards, Okonma thanked Q-Tip, Andr√©
                3000, Chad Hugo, Kanye West, Missy Elliot, Busta Rhymes, and Hype Williams as his influences.
