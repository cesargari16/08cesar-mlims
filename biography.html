            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Tyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991), known professionally as
                Tyler, the Creator, is an American rapper and record producer. He is
                one of the founding members of the music collective Odd Future.

                Okonma self-released his debut mixtape Bastard in 2009 and rapidly gained attention among the online
                music press for his horrorcore-influenced sound and violent, transgressive lyrical content. His debut
                studio album Goblin (2011), brought him mainstream exposure aided by the popularity of the single
                "Yonkers" and its accompanying music video. During this period, Odd Future gained rapid popularity and
                Okonma faced controversy over his lyrics. Beginning with his second album Wolf (2013), Okonma began
                moving away from his stylistic horrorcore towards a more alternative hip hop sound. His 2015 album
                Cherry Bomb featured a greater focus on melody and jazz-fused sounds which has continued throughout his
                later discography. Okonma's later albums, Flower Boy (2017), Igor (2019) and Call Me If You Get Lost
                (2021), were all released to widespread critical acclaim, with the latter two debuting at number one on
                the Billboard 200 and each winning Best Rap Album at the 2020 and 2022 Grammy Awards, respectively.

                In 1979 Miró received a doctorate honoris causa from the University of
                Barcelona. The artist, who suffered from heart failure, died in his
                home in Palma (Majorca) on 25 December 1983. He was later interred in
                the Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.

                It has been established through the analysis of personal texts written
                by Joan Miró that he has experienced multiple episodes of depression
                throughout his life. He experienced his first depression when he was
                18 in 1911. Much of the literature refers to this as if it was a small
                setback in his life, while it appeared to be much more than that. Miro
                himself stated: I was demoralized and suffered from a serious
                depression. I fell really ill, and stayed three months in bed. There
                is a clear connection between his mental health and his paintings,
                since he used painting as a way of dealing with his episodes of
                depression. It supposedly even made him more calm and his thoughts
                less dark. Joan Miró said that without painting he became very
                depressed, gloomy and I get ‘black ideas’, and I do not know what to
                do with myself. The influence of his mental state is very well visible
                in his painting Carnival of the Harlequin. He tried to paint the chaos
                he experienced in his mind, the desperation of wanting to leave that
                chaos behind and the pain created because of that. Miró painted the
                symbol of the ladder here which is also visible in multiple other
                paintings after this painting. It is supposed to symbolize escaping.
                The relation between creativity and mental illness is very well
                studied. Creative people have higher chances of suffering from a manic
                depressive illness or schizophrenia, as well as higher chance to
                transmit this genetically. Even though we know Miró suffered from
                episodic depression, it is uncertain whether he also experienced manic
                episodes, which is often referred to as bipolar disorder.
